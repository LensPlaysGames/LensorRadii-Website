                    😆<br />
                    In all seriousness, there's not a lot that goes into it<br />
                    <br />
                    I boot up FL Studio, pop in a couple sounds, record some vocals, and... that's all, right‽<br />

                    Oh, the naivete 😔<br />
                    Music is Simple, Yes, but it is not easy. It requires a total disconnect from self while at the same time generating enough 'ego-kindling' to burn you down faster than you could say 'Motherfucker'.<br />
                    <br />
                    You need the <strong>confidence</strong> to scream, but the right amount of <em>tenderness</em> to seem just genuine enough.<br />
                    <br />
                    The finesse of a tight-rope walker but the belligerence of a Karen at her favorite bar, drunk, telling ALL her friends how 'open' she is and how much she's been missing someone 'like that' for too long...<br />
                    <br />
                    Or you just get in there and yell the same word for 3 minutes (looking at you, 'lil' rappers 😁)<br />
                </div>

            <div class="card gradient-diag">
                <div class="card-header"><h1>Vibe</h1></div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    After a few months of rapping, I started to be able to think of lyrics not as words, but as what they truthfully are: a tool.<br />
                    With this revelation, I started to understand music I had not been able to before, as when I started out, ALL I could focus on <small>(especially in a rap/hip-hop song)</small> was the <strong>words</strong> that went with the <em>lyrics</em>.<br />
                    But then, I got it! <br />
                    <br />
                    Sometimes life is <strong>so</strong> shit, all you can manage to do is <small>(barely)</small> bop your head to whatever useless frequency is mindlessly flowing through your ears, into your skull.<br />
                    And without that mindless, unbiased frequency, it can seem like <em>all</em> you are left with is shit...<br />
                    <br />
                    Once I realized this, I started to make new goals. No longer was I after the 'most-intricate bar' or 'spitting the fastest verse'. No... <strong>Now</strong>, this was <strong><em>real</em></strong><br />
                    <br />
                    As real as Wind against the Stone.<br />
                    Water upon the Sand.<br />
                    A breeze in your face, carrying your soul to a far-away land...<br />

                <div class="card-header"><h1>Quality Audio</h1></div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    Early into my music journey, I found that sound quality was a large factor in whether people would even consider your music as valid. Because of that, I chose to build a broke-man's vocal booth (of which I am pictured in below), constructed out of a mattress, two blankets, and <em>many</em> pillows.<br />
                    Albeit, this did not gain me <em>any</em> listeners, I pressed on, knowing this improved sound was something <strong>I</strong> am <em>actually</em> happy with.<br />

                    I also found that the more thought you give something, that doesn't necesarrily translate into the finished product or, what really even matters: You.<br />

                    Although, without each previous moment, I wouldn't be who I am in the current one...<br />
                    So who knows...<br />

                    <br />
                    <em>Until Then, </em><br />
